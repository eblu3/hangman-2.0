Welcome to HangMan 2.0! If this is your first time 
playing please read these simple instructions. The point of HangMan 2.0 
is to guess the phrase given before your hangman has been completely hung. 
You'll be given a full keyboard of letters to select. Choose each letter wisely,
you won't have a lot of room for mistakes. If you guess a letter that is not 
in the word, a part of the hangman will be added to the board. If you guess 
a letter that happens to be in the word or phrase no pieces will be added
to the hangman.
